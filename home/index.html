      <span>NodeJS Workshop</span>
      <span>ACM - Philip Kenny</span>
      <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside
        of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side
        scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's
        web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application
        development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side
        scripts. In this workshop, we will be learning about the basic utilization of one of the most utilized
        frameworks in the CS work field for full-stack development, and how you can personally learn and utilize this
        framework in your own projects.</p>

      <span>API Workshop</span>
      <span>ACM - Philip Kenny</span>
      <p>API's are services available that you can either create or utilize from a third party from web-based systems,
        database systems, or software libraries. They are essential for performing functionalities that your project
        doesn't have, or does not need to be developed as it is already created. Utilizing API's are effective for
        having less of a process load on your server, having overall simpler code and maintenance. Since web-based
        programs are very common to utilize API's, in this workshop we will teach how to communicate with a web-based
        API, and utilize this data for your website.</p>
